01. Add data in different formats to tests directory for use in unit-tests
02. Massively neaten up data extraction. After each stage test plotting_scripts:
    - simplify what is returned from extract routines
    - add unit-tests
    - reorganise to minimise code duplication
    - rename and reorganise in repository
03. Tricontour plots for non-orthogonal grids
04. Remove plotting control
05. Much more thorough set of unit-tests:
    - for data coordinates
    - for data extraction
    - for each type of plot, and main useful features:
        - remove contours
        - rescaling colours
        - transparency
        - quivers
        - spherical centres
06. Work out appropriate interface for my / LFRic / Gusto plotting scripts.
    - i.e. results and plotting directories could be passed as arguments
    - how do we do this without duplicating code in every plotting script?
07. Provide examples / templates
08. Move plotting scripts to their own project repositories
08. Routine for quick plot of data. Maybe this plotting script can have lots of optional args?
09. Fix lint
10. Provide a quick way to plot perturbations
11. Provide some common thermodynamic expressions
12. Provide a routine for plotting tile colours
13. Provide support for quickly looping through something to make side-by-side plots?
