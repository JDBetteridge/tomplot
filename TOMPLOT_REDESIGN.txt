TOMPLOT REDESIGN
================

What is the bare minimum that the user should specify?
    * layout of the figure [should this just be subplots? Default is not subplots but 1x1]
    * size of the figure
    * legend / colorbar location? [how is this different when we have subplots?]
    * what each subplot is [e.g. field plot, time series, etc]
    * the data file(s?) to extract from
    * what field/time index should be extracted
    * how data should be interpolated (or not)



What are the different stages in going from user -> plot?
    (A) Specify figure layout
    (B) For each subplot, extract data
    (C) For each subplot, manipulate data
    (D) For each subplot, specify type of plot
    (E) For each subplot, specify details

What are the right interfaces for the different stages to:
* provide flexibility, since I won't be able to cover all cases
* minimise code duplication
* make it really obvious how to do the most basic things


PLOT TYPES
- time series
- convergence plot
- 1D field plot
- 2D field plot with contour (needs mesh-grid)
- 2D field plot through scattering
- 2D field plot with tricontour
- optional: histogram
- optional: bar chart

Priority list
-------------
(1) Removing enormous argument lists from plotting scripts
(2) Add new plotting capabilties (tricontour/scatter)
(3) Add lint checking and neaten up base plotting scripts
(4) Neaten and reorganise plotting tools -- add unit-tests for these
(5) Reorganise data extraction / manipulation
(6) Design top level interface (if any) for subplots
(7) Make tomplot_lite
